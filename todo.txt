unicode identifier support (native and \u)
object literal compilation should use numerify strings
support unions (right now 0-1 fields parsed as struct)
\\\n escapes in strings aren't handled in the console
look into what String is, and whether to bridge it
the console frontend's error handling, well, doesn't
Objective-C needs to be able to hook ffi_call for errors
