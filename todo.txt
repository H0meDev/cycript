labelled statements don't get labelled
blocks and empty statements are poorly factored
functors use both ffiData and ffoData...
rename "data" variables to "internal"
unicode identifier support (native and \u)
object literal compilation should use numerify strings
support unions (right now 0-1 fields parsed as struct)
