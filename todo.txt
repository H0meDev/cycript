labelled statements don't get labelled
blocks and empty statements are poorly factored
unicode identifier support (native and \u)
object literal compilation should use numerify strings
support unions (right now 0-1 fields parsed as struct)
\\\n escapes in strings aren't handled in the console
look into what String is, and whether to bridge it
